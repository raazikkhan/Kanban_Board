## 🧩 Application Behavior

### Board

The application contains one Kanban board with five columns.

Each column can be renamed while the overall number of columns remains fixed.

### Cards

Each card contains only:

- **Title**
- **Details**

Users can create a card inside any column and delete cards when they are no longer needed.

### Drag and Drop

Cards can be dragged and moved between any of the five columns.

The interface should provide clear visual feedback during drag-and-drop interactions.

### Dummy Data

The application starts with predefined dummy data so users can immediately interact with the board without needing to create content manually.

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Principles

The primary focus of this project is a polished user experience.

The interface should be:

- Clean
- Modern
- Professional
- Responsive
- Intuitive
- Visually balanced
- Easy to navigate

The application should prioritize visual quality and interaction design over unnecessary functionality.

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application should provide a smooth experience across:

- Desktop
- Laptop
- Tablet
- Mobile devices

The board should remain usable on smaller screens while preserving the drag-and-drop experience wherever possible.

---

## 🧠 Data Management

This MVP does not use a database or persistent storage.

All board data is managed on the client side.

```text
Application Load
       ↓
Dummy Data
       ↓
Client State
       ↓
User Interactions
       ↓
Updated UI
```

Refreshing the page resets the board to its initial dummy data.

1. Build a functional Kanban board
2. Provide a smooth drag-and-drop experience
